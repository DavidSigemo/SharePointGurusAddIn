This is an AddIn for SharePoint developed by David, Chro & Rozhna for the course SharePoint-utveckling - klienttekniker at Nackademin 2016.

The AddIn consists of an AppPart and a Single Page Application that displays the current weather as well as a forecast for the upcoming days. There is a settings window where you can change location, temperature unit, and other things.

The weather data being used is from the DarkSky API, which allows up to 1000 requests per day for free. After the free requests are used up the price is $0.0001 per forecast. This resets the next day.

AppPart:


Single Page Application:
The Single Page Application(SPA) contains more detailed information about the weather. There are three tabs with diffrent information. 

The first tab contains detailed information about the current weather.
